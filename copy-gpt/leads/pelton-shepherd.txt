OUR PRODUCTS: 

1. GLACIERTEMP:

Trusted When Cold Matters

Backed by decades of performance, our GlacierTemp cold packs and foam bricks offer a range of price points and features for shipping needs that require +30°F formulations.

GLACIER ICE
Ideal Everyday Refrigerant Solution:
Our most cost-effective refrigerant product, Glacier Ice delivers +30°F temperature control in a low-cost, nontoxic, non-caustic formulation. While the product can be reused, its economical cost makes it an ideal choice for one-way shipments. Glacier Ice packs are best suited for pack-outs that allow variable height tolerance.


GLACIER MOISTURE GUARD
“Sweat Proof” to Reduce Risk of Moisture Damage:
Glacier Moisture Guard packs contain the same reliable +30°F refrigerant formula as our trusted Glacier Ice products but feature a specially designed exterior material that absorbs condensation on contact. This superior performance makes Moisture Guard ideal for shipments with sensitive inner packaging or other contents susceptible to moisture damage.

Glacier Foam Brick:
Shapeable Foam Designed for Tight Pack-Outs:
Unlike rigid refrigerant blocks, Glacier Foam Bricks are specially formulated to mold flexibly for optimum space-efficiency and stability. Offering +30°F performance and the highest BTU absorption rate, they’re an ideal choice when space is limited.

Glacier Foam Bricks will retain their shape through freezing, thawing, and transit and can be molded to meet your packaging needs. A heavy-duty exterior material surrounds the malleable foam for added durability.


2. TERRATEMP
ENVIRO ICE
Plant Food That’s Also Drain- and Septic-Safe
Enviro Ice offers the reliability you need in a refrigerant solution, with game-changing performance and sustainability advantages. This patented innovation is backed by independent lab testing, and is available in 0°C and -12°C formulations.

Because of their unique formulation, Enviro Ice packs allow convenient, drain-safe disposal that will not harm PVC pipes or septic systems. They’re also the only cold pack that can be recycled as plant food! When thawed and diluted with water, the Enviro Ice coolant mixture is a safe, suitable fertilizer for both indoor and outdoor plants.

ECOGEL
Leak-Resistant Refrigerant
EcoGel packs are made of a dense gel with a consistency comparable to a dough. The gel does not leak out of a small puncture of the pack and expands only minimally during freezing, allowing tighter pack-outs. Added benefit: the gel is made from biodegradable ingredients.


3. CURATEMP
CURATEMP PRO
Premium Gel Ice Refrigerant
CuraTemp Pro refrigerant safely ensures temperature accuracy using a semi-solid nontoxic gel with a neutral pH. The formula that launched the gel ice industry, CuraTemp Pro is made from food-grade and organic materials. Its unique self-insulating ability allows heat to transfer at a consistent rate throughout the thawing process, delivering reliable temperature control at multiple eutectic points.

This unique formula expands only minimally when frozen, reducing the risk of unpredictable shifts in the event of a phase change.

CuraTemp Pro is offered in a number of eutectic points: +30°F, +10°F, -4°F, and -10°F.
